					<p style="margin-top:45px;">On October 22, 1991, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) sent a letter to the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR). It conveyed the President's sanction for a new biology research centre in Bangalore. Only upon looking back, however, does the letter appear as a bookend of sorts to a decade-plus quest for an independent space for biology.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) completes 25 years this year. NCBS@25 celebrates that. It is built around seven themes to reflect upon the history of the institution. Stories sometimes surface by bestowing significance on available material, willing them to become inflection points. Even cracks in the walls of institutions can take upon a life of their own. The themes bring to light the tapestry of NCBS, weaved by over 70 story tellers. Along with over 600 photographs, official records, letters, and the occasional lab note, they allow a glimpse into a tangled history and unlikely journey.</p>
